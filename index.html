          <h2>Software</h2>
          <p>
            Software development has been on Vartan's mind ever since she was
            a kid growing up with an old PC running Windows 3.11 and Windows 95.
            Through humble beginnings experimenting with Visual Basic at the age
            of 7, she delved deeper into the world of software, and by the time
            she was in her early teens, began to work as an IT consultant and
            developer for small business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Vartan started as a Microsoft developer primarily working
            with C# and ASP .NET, she has since embraced other platforms and
            tools, such as Node.js, Docker, and others, and is currently
            learning Rust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, Vartan is busy with the Unity game engine when not at
            work, and is an occassional contributor to open source projects
            online.

            was starting to compose music.
